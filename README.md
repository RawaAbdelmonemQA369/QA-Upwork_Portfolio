Sample QA artifacts — test cases, bug reports, and Gherkin scenario

This repository contains sample QA artifacts to demonstrate manual testing skills:
- Gherkin scenario examples
- Test case templates
- Sample bug reports (dummy data only)

## About
I am a Manual QA Tester focusing on functional, regression, and UAT testing.  
This repository uses only dummy/test data and does not include any real company or personal information.

## Files
- `Login.feature` — sample Gherkin scenario (BDD)
- `TestCases.md` — example test case templates in Markdown format
- `bug_report.csv` — sample bug report (CSV) with dummy data

I will continue adding more QA samples (test plans, screenshots, and templates).
